Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will identify the principle of Carey Foster’s Bridge. | Student will complete introduction. He will be given 4 images for the arrangement of Carey Foster’s Bridge and will choose correct image from them. | The correct image for the arrangement of Carey Foster’s Bridge is:<br><img src="images/carry_fosters1.png"><br>a) Image 1<br>b)Image 2<br>c)Image 3<br>d)Image 4
2.| To enable the student to describe the methodology to vary the resistance of the resistance box and to observe the variation in balancing length of the bridge wire. | Student will be given 4 images for the correct procedure to be followed in the experiment. He will choose correct image from them. | Choose the image which shows the correct order of the procedure to be followed in this experiment:<br><img src="images/carry_fosters2.png"><br>a)Image 1<br>b) Image 2 <br> c) Image 3 <br>d) Image 4
3.| Student will be able to Predict the resistance of the unknown wire by using the resistance per unit length calculated the balancing length of the wire and the resistance of the resistance box. | Student will make circuit connections followed by taking observations for balancing length l1 and l2 corresponding to the resistance of the resistance box. Student will also enter these lengths in table 1 and table 2 and the value of unknown resistance will be calculated. | The value of the balancing length l1 when the unknown resistance is connected across AB and a resistance of 5 ohms is taken out from the resistance box: <br> a) 48.0 cm <br> b) 49.0 cm<br>c) 47.0 cm<br>d) 46.0 cm
4.| Student will examine the radius and length of the unknown wire and calculate the value of specific resistance of the material of the wire. | Student will choose the radius and length of the unknown wire and will use the value of the unknown resistance calculated from the table 2, to calculate the value of specific resistance of the material of unknown wire.| Specific resistance of manganin wire is of the following order.<br>a) 4.33 x10-5 Ohm.cm<br>b) 4.33 x10-7 Ohm.cm <br>c) 4.33 x10-9 Ohm.cm <br>d) 4.33 x10-5 Ohm.m
5.| Conclude the specific resistance and to calculate the percentage error with the standard value. | Students will compare the value of the specific resistance of the material of the wire calculated with the standard value to calculate the percentage error occurred in the observation. | On increasing the radius of the wire the specific resistance of the material of the wire:<br>a) Increases<br>b) decreases<br>c) remains constant<br>d) NOT

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click the power button of the simulator to ON position<br> and One pop up image will appear<br> to ask the correct circuit diagram. | Simulator will allow student to Enable Power<br> and then make connections and <br>will alert him in case of wrong connections made  | To initiate the simulator and to assess the basic understanding of the student about the experiment
2.| Student will choose the desired load resistance and then connect the circuit to start the experiment. | Simulator will show the green light indicating that it is ready for use and will allow the student to choose the load resistance  | To find the balancing length l1 and l2
3.| Student will insert the balancing length l1 and l2 corresponding to each load resistance and mention these values in the table. | Simulator will show the corresponding balancing length l1 and l2  | To get the Mean ρ and Mean Y values
4.| Student will choose length and radius of cross section of the wire whose specific resistance is to be measured | Simulator will calculate Mean ρ and Mean Y values  | To Calculate the specific resistance of the given wire.
5.| Student will verify the experiment by comparing the calculated value with the standard value | Simulator will Calculate the specific resistance of the given wire  | Student will note if the value of the specific resistance is close to the standard result. If there is more deviation, then the simulator will ask the student to perform the experiment again.
